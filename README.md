This repository is used to create a serverless plugin that makes writing Output for Resources in a developer friendly way inside serverless.yml file

### ðŸ“¦ Install
```sh
npm i -D serverless-exports
# or
yarn add -D serverless-exports
```

### Features & Usage

Add the plugin before any other plugin
```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-exports
  - ...
```

Export cloudformation stack outputs in `key: value` pairs -
```yaml
...
Outputs:
  exportKey: exportValue

```
or if you want to give your key a different name instead of the logical Id, you can define like below -
```yaml
Outputs:
  <logicalId>:
    your_output_key_name: "some value"
```
`your_output_key_name` will be available as an exported key in your stack.

You can also directly declare your exports at `Resource` level if required
```yaml
Resources:
  myQueue:
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
    Outputs:
     myKey: myValue
```
`myKey` will be available in your stack outputs that you can refer to

> **Note**: Duplicate keys declared across the `Outputs` and all the `Resources` will be rejected
